Hello,

I am happy you got this download. Let me explain you a few points about it first. To be precise and clear,
#1. Check the folder "SuperCode". Locate the folder "_executables" under that.
#2. You'll notice a zip file "setup.zip". Extract the contents and run setup.bat. That's it!
#3. After you see that, I know you understand the value of what I want to show to you. Believe me, I searched for this functionality for almost a *month* and finally landed up writing a dll to have *this* functionality.
#4. Now locate another zip file "Login.zip" under "_zips" folder. Unzip it and run the project in VB. (It's more on tooltips!)
#5. I hope you'll go more eager to get *hold* of the source code. You *have* it with you, there!
#6. To have the *entire* grip on what's-behind-the-scenes, take a look at the source code from SystemInteroperatability.zip. 
#7. Although anybody would suggest to have a dll, I still recommend to have a look at the source. It's in VB and you definitely learn alot more.
#8. I end my points here. I love API's and I love developing. If you have *any* problem, any suggestion,
feel free to contact or better yet *mail* me.
#9. It's better to let me know about you, because that way I can inform you about any *new* features I
inlcude in future.
#10. There's still lot's more to come in the next versions..!! Happy Coding..!!

Thanks and see you again,
Shantibhushan
